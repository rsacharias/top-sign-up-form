# top-sign-up-form

This project is the first of the 'Intermediate HTML and CSS' course of the 'Full
Stack JavaScript' path of The Odin Project. Its goal is to strengthen HTML and
CSS concepts which the curriculum teaches up to this point. It focuses
particularly on the form element and its various widgets.
